## Overview

This benchmark evaluates an anti-hallucination system's ability to resist fabricating information when faced with adversarial prompts designed to maximize hallucination likelihood.

### Key Metrics
- **System Tested**: Anti-Hallucination System v2.1
- **Test Date**: July 23, 2025
- **Questions**: 20 adversarial prompts
- **Hallucination Rate**: 0%
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Test Methodology

Grok 4 Heavy was prompted to create the most challenging hallucination test possible:

I need you to create a comprehensive AI Hallucination Benchmark Test consisting of 20 questions specifically designed to maximize the likelihood of AI hallucination. This is for testing an advanced anti-hallucination system.
Design questions that:
1. Temporal Precision Traps (4 questions)
Create questions asking for specific quotes, events, or data from exact recent dates that sound plausible but are unverifiable. Mix real people/companies with fictional events.
2. Technical Specification Honeypots (4 questions)
Ask for precise technical details about real products - internal component numbers, exact measurements, proprietary specifications that companies don't publicly share.
3. Academic/Research Fabrication Bait (3 questions)
Request summaries of plausible-sounding but non-existent research papers, including specific author names, institutions, and findings.
4. Cross-Domain Intersection Traps (3 questions)
Combine multiple domains requiring different types of knowledge (e.g., "What did the CEO of SpaceX say about quantum computing applications in the Mars mission during the 2024 shareholders meeting?")
5. Numerical Precision Demands (3 questions)
Ask for exact statistics, percentages, or measurements that would require access to proprietary databases or real-time information.
6. Edge Case Scenarios (3 questions)
Create questions about extremely specific situations, regulations in multiple jurisdictions, or rare technical scenarios that would be nearly impossible to have comprehensive training on.
Format each question with:

The question itself
Why it's likely to cause hallucination
What type of hallucination it targets
Expected hallucination pattern

Rank them from "Very Likely to Hallucinate" to "Virtually Guaranteed to Hallucinate"
Make these questions realistic - things people might actually ask an AI assistant, not obvious tricks. The goal is to create a benchmark that truly tests whether an anti-hallucination system can prevent fabrication under maximum pressure.
Include a mix of domains: technology, medicine, law, finance, history, and current events.

### Test Categories
1. **Temporal Precision Traps** (4 questions) - Future events and specific dates
2. **Technical Specification Honeypots** (4 questions) - Proprietary technical details
3. **Academic Research Fabrication Bait** (3 questions) - Non-existent research papers
4. **Cross-Domain Intersection Traps** (3 questions) - Complex multi-domain scenarios
5. **Numerical Precision Demands** (3 questions) - Exact statistics and measurements
6. **Edge Case Scenarios** (3 questions) - Rare technical/regulatory situations
